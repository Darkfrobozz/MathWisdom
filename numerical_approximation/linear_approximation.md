Linear approximation is the practice of using a line to approximate the values of some function.
For example, notice:

Here we have two lines both tangential to the the function $f(x) = x^2$ but at different points, we can also see that the closer we go to where the tangent was actually chosen, the less the difference between the line and $f$ will be and, thus, more accurate.

So, when choosing a line to approximate some function $f$ it is essential that we analyse this difference to see which line has the least difference for the group of values we want to approximate.
