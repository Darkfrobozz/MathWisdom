Building on [[linear_approximation]], we can theorize that as we add more terms that change in distinct manners we can tweak it so that it approximates our [[function]].

Our approximation consists of a *n*th degree and a set of constants $A = \{ a_{0}, a_{1}, \dots a_{n} \}$ :
$$
f(x) \approx a_{0}x + a_{1}x^2 + a_{2}x^3 + \dots + a_{n}x^n
$$
