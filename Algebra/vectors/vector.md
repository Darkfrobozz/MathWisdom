When observing [[coordinate_system]], we can see that it can be made from vertically stacking [[number_line]].
But this process of vertically stacking has not been made thorough.

That is why we introduce vectors, a vector has a magnitude and a direction.
In 2D, we could define vectors based on coordinates :
$$
(x, y)
$$
In general, vectors is a building block for component based systems where some components are perpendicular or more generally orthogonal to eachother.

For example, the property of space against time may be viewed as orthogonal properties.
We can increase the space and apparatus takes without increasing the time it takes for the program.
Although this is not strictly true, we can model based on that assumption.

Thus, in general we can extend our vectors with more and more components to view more complex system such as 3D instead of 2D.
