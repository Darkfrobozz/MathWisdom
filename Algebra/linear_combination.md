Linear combinations is a limit on the operations we are allowed to do to combine elements.
Specifically, we can restrict so that we may only scale and add elements from our set.
Say we have a set of elements:
$$
(x_{n})
$$
Then we could represent the linear combinations of $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}$ as:
$$
A_{1}x_{1} + A_{2}x_{2} + A_{3}x_{3} 
$$
