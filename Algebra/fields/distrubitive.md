# Intuition
This connects addition with multiplication as :
$$
a(b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c
$$
Understanding this with our blocks suppose we have a segment of blocks $a$ extending (inclusive) out of a line of blocks of length $b$ and similarly for $c$ but putting them so that the length $c$ and $b$ face towards us, we can just push these two together and the length can be nothing other than $b + c$ providing intuition for this property
