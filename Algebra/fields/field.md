A field is a set of values that behaves as expected with our basic arithmetic operations.
This means it upholds [[associative]], [[distrubitive]] and [[commutative]].

However, we also have that a field must provide the existence of and additive and multiplicative inverse.
We also need the existence of the multiplicative and additive identity, which results if so required a field of at least two elements.
