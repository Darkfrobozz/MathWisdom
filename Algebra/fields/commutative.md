# Intuition
At its core commutative tells us to ignore the order of operations.
One operation being made to the left of another as no effect on the outcome.
We want to build an intuition for that adding two numbers :
$$
2 + 3 = 3 + 2
$$
Let's rely on representing each unit as a block.
Then adding from left to right is the same as putting two blocks in and then three blocks.
Of course, it makes sense that that would not change if we started with the other three blocks and then took two blocks.

Similarly, if we want to multiply two numbers:
$$
2 \cdot 3 = 3 \cdot 2
$$
This is because we can think of two blocks being lined up three in sequence.
But then, of course we can also view it from the other side which will be three blocks lined up in a sequence of two, a simple [[transponse]]!
$$
n\left(\begin{bmatrix}
0&0 \\
0&0 \\
0&0
\end{bmatrix}\right) = n\left(\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}\right)
$$
