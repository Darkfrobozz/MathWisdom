# Intuition
This relies on the idea of what operation can be done first, unlike [[commutative]] it is not about where each element is in relation to other elements but rather:
$$
5 + 2 + 4
$$
In our block analogy, this is simply a grouping of events, we put in five blocks and, then, put in 2 and 4 blocks. 
It can be considered the and, then, operator. 
In that manner, it is obviously true for our blocks since we are pouring in the same amount.

Similarly, for multiplication, we can construct a block cube of dimensions $k \times m \times n$
We can then of course rearrange this cube so that all rows form a line, giving us :
$$
km \times n
$$
Thus, we can understand how this property should hold for our blocks
