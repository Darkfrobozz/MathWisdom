A composition [[function]] $h$, $f$ composed of $g$ is written as:
$$
h = f \circ g
$$
This means that an input to $h$ is taken as an input to $g$ whose output is then taken as an input to $f$.
The resulting output of $f$ is the output of the composition.

When defining compositions it is important to note that the [[range]] of $g$ needs to match the [[domain]] of $f$, else we will for some valid inputs to the [[function]] $g$ get an invalid input to $f$.

This also implies that a composition's [[domain]] is a subset of the [[domain]] of the inner function $g$ and its [[range]] is a subset of its outer function $f$ [[range]].
