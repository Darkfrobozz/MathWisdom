The [[matrix]] product is the [[vector_dot_product]] of matching components :
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
5 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
5 & 3 \\
6 & 2
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
6 & 2 \\
28 & 17
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Here we can see that we take the vector product :
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
5 \\
6
\end{bmatrix} 
$$
To get index 0, 0 of the resulting matrix.

This kind of product results in a specific requirement that the first matrix must have the same amount of columns as the second matrix has rows.
And the columns of the second decides the resultant columns, similarly, the rows of the first is the rows of the result.
