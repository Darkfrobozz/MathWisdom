This operation flips a [[matrix]] on its diagonal, this can be visualized by the following :
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}^T = \begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
## Analogy
Takes a measuring device back to the space we started with instead of going to the other space.

Still giving the same result.
## Theory
In particular, the transpose is a linear map transforming a [[covector]] in the output [[vector_space]] to a covector in the input [[vector_space]].
