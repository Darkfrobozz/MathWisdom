The identity matrix is defined as the matrix with which we can perform a [[matrix_product]] with and receive the same result as the input.
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Is the identity for a square matrix of size two. Observe that any component wise [[vector_dot_product]] is only defined by the matching column or row's component.
As we multiply all other parts by zero.
