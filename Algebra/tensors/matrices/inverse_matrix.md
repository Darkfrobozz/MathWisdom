The inverse [[matrix]] is defined as the [[matrix]] to some [[matrix]] $A$ with which we can perform the [[matrix_product]] and the result will be the [[identity_matrix]].

The most intuitive process to solve this is to perform the basic row operations and have an identity matrix on the side that performs the same row operations.

Thus, we can track the process of creating the [[identity_matrix]] from our matrix $A$ by another matrix that step by step represent the chain of row operations performed.

Essentially, we use the property that a matrix can represent a sequence of row operations to create our inverse matrix.
