The determinant represents the nth dimensional space of a nth dimensional parallelpipped.
For example, for a [[matrix]] in two dimensions it would represent the area of the parallelogram outlined by the [[basis_vectors]] represented by the [[matrix]].
The [[identity_matrix]] should by definition represent a space of exactly 1.
Another important point is that if the parallelpipped formed is fully in a lower dimension than n then it occupies 0 space in the nth dimensional space. This occurs when there is [[linear_dependency]] between columns of the matrix.
