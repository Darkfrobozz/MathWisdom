A matrix is a 2nd rank [[tensor]], which means that it has the following form :
$$
A =\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
2 &4
\end{bmatrix}
$$
In other words a 2d array, of special interest is access notation :
$$
A_{11} = 0, A_{12} = 1, A_{21} = 2, A_{21} = 4 
$$
Moreover, we call the $0,1$ part a row and the $0,2$ part a column.

## Basic Operations
Addition is quick intuitive on matrixes as we simply add corresponding elements.

Scalar multiplication is also very intuitive, we just distribute to all components.

## Geometric Meaning
A matrix in linear algebra is used as notation for a [[linear_transformation]], specifically, the columns of a matrix tells us where the standard [[basis_vectors]] should land.
