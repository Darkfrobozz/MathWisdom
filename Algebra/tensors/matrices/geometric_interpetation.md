# Introduction
We are interested in equations :
$$
b = Ax
$$
$A$ is here some matrix that maps $x$ to $b$ :

# Standard Basis
Let's consider the standard basis of some vector space.
These by definition will have linear combinations that span that vector space.

# Relation to Matrice
We can now observe that if we multiply :
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 0 \\
-5 & 3 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
0
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
-5
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Then we see where the standard basis is located in when mapping from $R^3$ to $R^2$
Thus, we can correctly identify that a matrix's columns simply tells us where the standard basis land.
This remapping of the basis to other vectors shows us a proof of the linearity as we will always stay within the span of the new vectors?
