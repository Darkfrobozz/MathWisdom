When observing [[coordinate_system]], we can see that it can be made from vertically stacking [[number_line]].
But this process of vertically stacking has not been made thorough.

That is why we introduce tensors, a tensor is a mathematical object that aims to represent properties in relation to each other.
In 2D, we could define a first rank tensor based on coordinates : $(x,y)$
