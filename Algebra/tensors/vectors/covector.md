A measuring device or [[function]] that is a [[linear_transformation]] that takes a [[vector]] and outputs a single number.
Since it is linear, we simply need to know what the basis of a vector space maps to so we can build a covector as a single [[vector]] :
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{1} \\
a_{2} \\
a_{3} \\
a_{4} \\
\dots \\
a_{n}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
We can visualize covectors as gridlines.
