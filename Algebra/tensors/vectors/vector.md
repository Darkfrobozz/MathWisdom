Vectors are first rank [[tensor]]s:
$$
\vec{x} =[x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}]
$$
In general, our vector can represent any number of coefficients.
These constructs are useful in representing systems where some components are perpendicular or more generally orthogonal to each other.

For example, the property of space against time may be viewed as orthogonal properties.
We can increase the space an apparatus takes without increasing the time it takes for the program.
Although this is not strictly true, we can model based on that assumption.

Thus, in general we can extend our vectors with more coefficients to view more complex system such as 3D instead of 2D.
