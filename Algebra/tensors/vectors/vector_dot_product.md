This is also called a scalar product.
This is because we are combining components by summing corresponding components.
For any two vectors of rank *n* we have that:
$$
\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = \sum_{i=0}^{n}a_{i}b_{i}
$$
Intuitively, if we move in some component in both then the multiplication is the movement multiplied. Thus, we can see that we are multiplying the distance of each component
