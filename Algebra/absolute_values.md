An intuitive approach to absolute values is to consider the distance from the number it represents to zero.

For example, for real numbers, we can take a number on the [[number_line]] and measure the distance to zero to find the absolute values.

This implies that the absolute value of the negative version of a number is equal to the absolute value of that number.
