This axiom states that every bounded set has a least upper bound, it is called the supremum.
The axiom is a statement of existence.

To understand it, we have to understand bounds.
An upper bound to a set $A$ is a number $b$ such that for every value $x \in A : x \leq b$
Now, consider the set of all upper bounds to $A$ such that it is $B$.

The axiom of completeness then states that there exists a number $b$ in $B$ such that there is no value $x$ in B such that:
$$
x < b
$$
