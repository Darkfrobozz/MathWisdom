Based on [[continous_limits]], we are able to define a new property of [[points]] in relation to [[function]]s.

Given some point $a$, the function $f(x)$ is continuous at $a$ if and only if:
$$
\lim_{ x \to a } f(x) = f(a) \tag{1}
$$
This definition of continuity then extends to the entirety of the function, that is a function $f$ is continuous on $R$ if and only if for all point in $R$, $(1)$ holds.
