Given two continuous functions $f$ and $g$, we want to understand the properties of their composites.
- Sum: $f + g$
- Product: $f \cdot g$
- Scalar: $k \cdot f$

For any point $a$ in their domain, we have that both functions are defined since [[continuity]] implies that they are defined.
Moreover, for both of these:
$$
\lim_{ x \to a } f(x) = f(a) \land \lim_{ x \to a } g(x) = g(a)
$$
Thus, by [[continous_limits_arthimetics]], we find that in each case the limit is the value of the point which implies that the composite function is indeed continuous.
