These involve only a finite collection of values changing in respect to some value.

## Example
Imagine throwing a ball upwards, then we have gravity acting on it to accelerate downwards. This is a constant $g$ so it is very easy to ascertain, what is harder to figure out is the equation for its position. This is an ODE, since we know the differential but not the function. WE could figure this out by [[integral]]s.
