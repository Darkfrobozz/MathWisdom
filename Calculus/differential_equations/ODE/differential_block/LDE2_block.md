First we can use [[vector_space_HLDE]] to create a complementary function for the LDE of degree two, this is the solution for it if it were homogenous. Thus, describing all situations where some parts of it equals zero.
We can use this complementary function together with a nonhomogeneous part to deduce it's general solution by finding a particular solution.
