These equations are called separable:
$$
y'(x) = f(x)g(y)
$$
Often it is taught that:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} 
$$
Can be split and, thus, integration can occur, we will be using implicitly [[u_sub]].
$$
\frac{y'}{g(y)} = -p(x) = \ln |g(y)|  = -\int p(x) \, dx
$$
$$
g(y) = e^{-u(x) + C} = e^Ce^{-u(x)} = Ke^{-u(x)}
$$
