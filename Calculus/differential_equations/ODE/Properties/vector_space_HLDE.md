For HLDE, we have the proposition that the solutions are [[vector_space]]s:
Given two solutions: 
$$
y = y_{1}(x) \land y = y_{2}(x) \implies y = Ay_{1}(x) + By_{2}(x)
$$
First scaling is easy to prove, multiplying by $0$ is still $0$ and adding two solutions, we get that:
$$
y_{1}(x) + y_{2}(x) = 0
$$
Because of the [[commutative]] property of real numbers, we can simply reorder it.
