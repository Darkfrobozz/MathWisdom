A property that is easy to investigate about a differential equation is the order, which is the highest derivative present.

Another property that is important is linearity, a linear differential is when the derivatives are only combined with addition and multiplication with a function of $x$ and only not multiplied with any $y$ function.

$$
a_{n}y^{(n)}(x) +
a_{n- 1}y^{(n-1)}(x) +
a_{n-2}y^{(n-2)}(x) + \dots
a_{1}y^{(1)}(x) +
a_{0}y(x) +
=f(x)
$$

The term $f(x)$ is the nonhomogeneous part.
If $f(x) = 0$, we have that it is homogeneous.
