Using [[cauchy_criterion]], we can construct a criterion for series, namely that a series:
$$
A = \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty} a_{i}
$$
Converges if and only if for all $\varepsilon > 0$, we can find:
$$
\sum_{n}^{\infty} < \varepsilon
$$
If we have that the sequence produced by a sum converges then by the [[cauchy_criterion]], we have that subsequent elements eventually get arbitrarily close. Thus, it must be convergent. Furthermore, if a series follows the above then $A_{n} - A_{m}< \varepsilon$ and it converges by [[cauchy_criterion]].
