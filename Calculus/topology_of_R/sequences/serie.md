A serie $A_{n}$ can be found represented with the sigma notation:
$$
A_{n} = \sum_{i = 0}^n a_{i}
$$
Where $a_{i}$ is a [[sequence]], recursively we define it as:
$$
A_{n + 1} = A_{n} + a_{n + 1} \land A_{0} = a_{0}
$$
Then we see that we have from that derived a [[sequence]] : $(A_{n})$
Which means that all the proofs to [[sequence]] apply to series.
The trick is understanding how that relates to the terms in the series.
