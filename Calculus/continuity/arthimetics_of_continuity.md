Given the definition of [[continuity]] and [[continous_limits_arthimetics]], we want to prove the following proposition $P_{1}$:
	The continuity property of functions is transferred through arithmetic operations.
Now, we can use the fact that [[continuity]] is based on limits to assert that if $f$ and $g$ have some limit when their input is moving towards some point then any of the three arithmetic operations of interest on those [[function]]s will result in the same operation on their limits based on [[continous_limits_arthimetics]].
Finally, using the fact of [[continuity]] that the limit is the output of the function at the point its input is moving towards.
We have from that we are simply arithmetically combining the functions that the combined limit is indeed moving towards the output of the combined function. Thus, proving $P_{1}$.
