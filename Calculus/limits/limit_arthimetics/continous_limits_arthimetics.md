Finally, to tie the whole idea of limit arithmetic together, we have to address continuous limits.
The proposition $P_{1}$ is the following:
	All arithmetic rules for [[discrete_limits]] apply to [[continous_limits]].

To prove this proposition, notice that we used [[discrete_limits]] to prove [[continous_limits]], we then want to prove that all discrete sequences towards the new composite point generated by:
$$
x + y \lor x \cdot y \lor x \cdot k
$$
Is also generated by some pair of sequences towards the two components.

To prove this we simply need to grab some discrete sequence towards that composite point and realize that if we do the opposite arithmetic action by a sequence towards the *y* or *k* component, we will get a sequence towards the *x* component.
Thus, generating a pair of discrete sequences corresponding to a discrete sequence towards the composite points.

Consequently, since we have proved [[product_of_limits]], [[scalar_of_limits]] and [[sum_of_limits]] for [[discrete_limits]], it implies that every [[discrete_limits]] towards a composite point in [[continous_limits]] follow these exact rules.

However, there is a special case, when the *y* or *k* component is 0.
This is because we can't divide by 0.
The key here is to realize that for *k* there is only one [[discrete_limits]], which is only 0:s and for $x \cdot y$, Each [[discrete_limits]] will move towards 0, which is the correct [[continous_limits]] from the combination.

Consequently, $P_{1}$ holds.
