We set out to prove that the [[derivative]] at an extreme point is always $0$ and for the sake of argument we will only concern us about the case in which the extremum is a maximum.

Suppose then that we have an internal maximum and it has a derivative that is not $c \neq 0$
Then, we have two cases:
$$
\begin{cases}
c > 0 \\
c < 0
\end{cases}
$$
If we have that it is bigger than zero then we can assume that there exists a point to its right that is bigger than the internal maximum, we can assume this because if it did not exist than the [[derivative]], which will be calculated based of a sequence of these points must be less or equal to zero.
This is of course contradictory since we assumed that this was the internal maximum
In the second case, we can simply assume that there is a point to the left that is bigger than the internal maximum.
Thus, our proof is complete since if it can neither be bigger or smaller than 0 it must be 0 given that the [[derivative]] is defined.
