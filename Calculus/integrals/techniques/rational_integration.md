The key here is employing the [[u_sub]] technique. We want to construct a format wherein we can use [[u_sub]] and a rational expression can include a fractional part and to deal with this part: 
We use [[partial_fractional_decomposition]] because since we get a format where each fraction's numerator is one degree less than our denominator and for the most part linear denominators. 
We have that for linear expressions that the derivative of the denominator is a scalar multiplied by the [[field]].
Thus, we have a way to break down rational expressions to integrate them using [[u_sub]].
