u substitution is the reverse of the [[chain_rule]].
It is integration by finding what is the derivative of a component and the [[fundamental_thereom_of_calculus]] giving us the connection between derivatives and integrals to substituting that component with a $u$.
From the [[fundamental_thereom_of_calculus]] we have that the integral is an antiderivative which means that the derivative of the integral is the expression that was integrated.
Consequently, since if a component was replaced with $u$, the derivative remains exactly the same except for the [[chain_rule]].
Consequently, the derivative will be correct if we account for the derivative of the component, which is what we do when substituting.
We check whether the derivative can be extracted from the expression, commonly by dividing the expression by the derivative.
