An integral is the process of adding up a bunch of tiny bits.
This allows us to divide and conquer complex tasks.
Instead of solving the big task we often have a simpler module that we can solve in each frame.
This let's us add up each frame to solve the big task.

We effectively take [[serie]]s into hyperdrive as integration is the process of continually making the [[serie]]s fit the actual task better and better.
To prove this we simply have to prove that the sum of the terms will be closer than the previous sum and if the limit of this process gives us what we desired we have the integral.
