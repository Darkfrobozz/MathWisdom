The fundamental thereom of calculus gives us a connection between [[integral]]s and [[derivative]]s, it comes in two parts :

Firstly, it states that given a [[function]] $f$ with [[continuity]] over an interval with an upper bound has an integral.

Secondly, it states that given any integral $F$ of a function $f$ :
$$
F' = f
$$
