# Proposition
The fundamental theorem of calculus gives us a connection between [[integral]]s and [[derivative]]s, it comes in two parts :

Firstly, it states that [[existence_of_integral]].

Secondly, it states that given any integral $F$ of a function $f$:
$$
F' = f
$$

# Proof
Let's assume that $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$
Then, we think of it like the following :

What we are claiming is that the [[integral]], specifically the [[integral]] in respect to small portions of $x$ over $[a,b]$ exists.
