Let's consider a sequence $(a_{n})$ within a bounded interval :
$$
(-M, M)
$$
Then, we know that there either exists an infinite amount of points on both or one of the sides of 0.
Using this we can narrow down our search for a subsequence to for example :
$$
[0, M]
$$
And pick a point that fall on the right side to be our $a_{o}$ and, then,
we again know that on one or both sides of $\frac{1}{2M}$ there must be an infinite amount of points.
So, we again pick the side where we find an infinite amount of points and we pick such that $a_{1} \not \in \{ a_{0} \}$.

We then continue like this and, since, by necessity our points get closer to eachother we have by the [[cauchy_criterion]] that this subsequence is convergent.
Thus, any bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence.
