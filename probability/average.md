There are several different ways of predicting what an element will be if picked at random.
For example:
- Arithmetic mean - Dividing the sum over the amount of elements
- Geometric mean - Dividing the product over the amount of element
- Median - In a discrete ordering of the elements, picking the middle value
- Mode - The value that occurs the most

For all over these we have different properties such as if we choose the mode we will most often get the value that we predict, if we choose the median we will always have a value in the middle of all the possible values. With the mean, we know that the value we picked is arithmetically closest to all the values.
