The main proposition is that:
$$
P(H | E) = \frac{P(H) \cdot P(E | H)}{P(E)}
$$
The following relates the chance of some hypothesis being true given some evidence to the chance of that hypothesis being true times the probability of the evidence being implied by that hypothesis and, then, dividing over the overall chance of the evidence being true.
Essentially breaking out how much of when the evidence is true is made up of the hypothesis implying it to be so.

The use case comes up a lot of the time in probability as we tend to focus in on some set of recent correlations instead of looking at the complete picture. For example, looking at some set of traits, we might reduce them to a probability of having a job without taking into account the rate at which that job is available.

New evidence shall thus not completely determine beliefs.
The following is an geometry of the space of probability being restricted by evidence.
