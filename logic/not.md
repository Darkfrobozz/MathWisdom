The first rule of not is linking it to [[absurdity]] and [[if]]. That is if not $P$ is correct then if $P$, we have [[absurdity]].

In essence, not is strongly tied to [[absurdity]]. Thus, technique wise, if we can prove [[not]] we can often use it to deduce [[absurdity]] and we can use this to reduce the premises since only a set of premises where in the conclusion does not imply [[absurdity]] is logically consistent.

We have a not introduction rule which is using [[if]] in a derivation of absurdity.

The elimination sequent is that if we combine two sets of premises that conclude opposites, then, the union of these premises conclude [[absurdity]].

A set of premises that together with a statement produces [[absurdity]] concludes that such a premise must be false with those premises.
