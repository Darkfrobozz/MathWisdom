The introduction rule of or is that if a set of premises entail atleast one of $o$ and $w$, we have that this set entails $o\lor w$

The elimination rule is that if $o \lor w$ and a set of premises with $o$ results in $x$ and that same set of premises with $w$ results in $x$ then we know that $x$ is true with these premises.
