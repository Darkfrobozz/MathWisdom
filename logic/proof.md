A proof consists of three parts:
- Target
- Sources
- Execution
Given some [[set]] of sources, the proof, to be valid is supposed to prove that the target is true through its execution.

The [[set]] of sources is also called assumptions, they need not be proven within the proof itself. However, if one wishes to show that the target is true, we nonetheless will have to substantiate the assumptions.

There are three ways to do this:
- We construct a valid proof whose target is an assumption, this becomes a lemma of the proof
- The assumption is 'self-evident' such as 0 = 0
- The assumption is discharged.

A sequent is related to statements about proofs, it is about the relationship between target and sources:
$$
\Gamma \vdash w
$$
This a sequent that says that the sources in the set $\Gamma$ entail $w$.
