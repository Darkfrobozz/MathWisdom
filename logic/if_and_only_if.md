This combines the idea of [[if]] as the core principle is that if either implies the other than if either is true then the other is true.

Consequently, we can introduce it through [[and]] introduction sequent.

The elimination rule just exposes the underlining [[and]] elimination rule as we then can take either of the [[if]] statements.

Recursive definition:
$$
(o \leftrightarrow  w) \leftrightarrow  ((o \to w) \land (w \to o))
