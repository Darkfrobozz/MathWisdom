The proposition is that any number $k \in \mathbb{N}$ can be expressed as $2m$ or $2m + 1$ for some $m \in \mathbb{N}$
This we can prove by picking the largest $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $2m \leq k$ :
Having that $m$, we can now proceed to claim that $2m \leq k < 2(m+1)$ if it were otherwise we would have picked $m+1$ to be our $m$ since that would have been larger since $\mathbb{N}$ is closed under addition.

Consequently, we know that $2m \leq k < 2m + 2$.
However, there are only two integers that fill that criteria $2m$ and $2m + 1$ :
Consequently, since $k$ is an integer it must be one of the two.
