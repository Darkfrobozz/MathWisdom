A function is much like a making tea, we put in a tea bag and get some flavor.
The flavor is the output and the input is the tea bag.
A key part of a function is its predictability.
Thus, mimicking the reality that if all else equal, putting in the same tea-bag, should result in the same flavor.

So in a formal way a function is the mapping from a set of inputs to a single output for each input.
$$
f(x) = y \land x = x_{1} => f(x) = f(x_{1})
$$

Of course, in reality there are a lot more factors to cooking tea, to make a more accurate function we can increase the input types, otherwise known as parameters.

For example,
$$
f(x, y)
$$
Here *y* can represent factors such as heat of the tea water.
