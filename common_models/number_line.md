# An Intuitive Approach
To measure change, we need a model for the different values that can appear.
The most basic model for this is the number line.

The number line is very arbitrary but an intuitive way to understand it is to think about a ruler.
Imagine if this 'ruler 1' had infinite precision, then, what we have is the number line in some unit such as centimeters.
All the different values that can possibly occur on this ruler 1 is represented on the number line.

Now, the negative part of the number line is simply a ruler 2 but measuring the opposite direction of our previous ruler 1.
One way to think about this is to consider the physical space that the rulers are in.
If we walk some value on ruler 1 and then decided to walk some value on ruler 2, then, since ruler 2 measures the opposite direction we would be walking backwards, netting us the intended effect of negative numbers using rulers.
