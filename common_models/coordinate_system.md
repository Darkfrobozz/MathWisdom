# An intuitive Approach
Using our definition of [[number_line]], similarly to how we introduced negative numbers, we can combine two number lines to construct a coordinate system.

For example, imagine a table and let one number line lie on that table and the other number line be at a right angle to the table.

Then, if we move our finger according to values of the number lines, we get the intended effect of the coordinate system model.

That is move some value according to the vertical number line and we move some vertical distance and, similarly, for the horizontal number line.

By convention, we call these number lines axis. The vertical is the *y* axis and the horizontal is the *x* axis.
Moreover, by convention we call the intersection of these axis the origin.
